' RC BUGS & LIMITATIONS
' =====================

' tooltips also resize when the whole thing is resized, code received from Olaf tested - resizing results in missing text and blank tooltips, using non-standard font centurion light
' RC6 needs a static tooltip option.

' when placing widgets on the main alpha form they take opacity changes and become fully transparent as expected, no problem.
' However, when placing widgets on top of other widgets the opacity cumulates and they become significantly more opaque.
' on circular elements, the surrounding transparent areas become opaque - this may be due to the increased shadow depth 
' when simple PSD parser used.
