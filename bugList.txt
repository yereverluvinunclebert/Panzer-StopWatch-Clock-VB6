NOTE:

When the RC6.DLL and RC6widgets.dll are registered elsewhere within another widget, then this widget will compile but not run.
In this case, the two DLLs in the local BIN folder need to be registered using the two Olaf-supplied scripts.

NOTE: When editing using the VB6 IDE started from the widget right click menu itself, it may not compile and run correctly.
- it may well run in the IDE but not as an .EXE run via the IDE 'run' button.
FIX: Initiate the IDE from the VBP file in the folder itself, opened using explorer
     Compile and then run from explorer. 
     Do not know why it only affects this widget alone.

Static Linking in TB only.
         In TwinBasic static library linking is possible allowing incorporation of DLLs into the misc section and compiling into the finished binary
