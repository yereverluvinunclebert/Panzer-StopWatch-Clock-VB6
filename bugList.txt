' RC BUGS
' =======

' about widget image shadows not rendering correctly in the stopwatch, same code on RC5 widget works correctly

' aboutForm is not fading back-in but instantly hiding in DPI aware mode, opacity is acting strangely on second fade in

' tooltips also resize when the whole thing is resized, which is not necessarily a good idea for a UI.

' how do I set the visibility of the W_ created widgets so I can temporarily
' make one invisible, for example a locking pin to be made invisible on a mouseDown then re-appear on a mouseUP.
