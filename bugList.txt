' in clock mode the timer calculates degrees for the hours and mins plus seconds
'   note: CW_Paint is called regularly not from a timer visible to us (can be redrawn using a refresh) but from a timer within the RC6 DLL.
'   CW_PAINT uses the calculated degrees from the rotation point for hours and mins plus seconds.
' in stopwatch mode, swhourhand, swminutehand and swsecondhand will rotate according to a set and stored start point, the start of the timer run
'    in CW_PAINT the code to rotate swhourhand, swminutehand and swsecondhand in a standard manner, will not be run
'       a new mode will remove the rotation of the minute/hour/second altogether from the CW_PAINT class.
'    new code and a new timer to rotate swhourhand, swminutehand and swsecondhand according to a newly calculated set of degrees of rotation from
'    the point the timer starts.
'    If button 1 is pressed for a second time, this just stops the hands rotating, the secondary timer itself continues.
'    When the timer is reset using the lower b, the main timer will have a flag to stop rotating the hands and a secondary timer will rotate them backward and reset the start point
'

' stopwatch mode press once on button 1 set and store a start point and start a timing run
' stopwatch mode press twice on button 1 pauses the hands on any current timing run but the run continues...
' stopwatch mode press thrice on button 1 resets the hands and stops the timing run
' stopwatch mode press button 3 unpauses a timing run

' RC BUGS & LIMITATIONS
' =====================

' tooltips also resize when the whole thing is resized, code received from Olaf tested - resizing results in missing text and blank tooltips, using non-standard font centurion light
' RC6 needs a static tooltip option.
