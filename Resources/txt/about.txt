PANZER STOP WATCH WIDGET

The Panzer stop watch Widget is a utility displaying a clock and stop watch in a dieselpunk fashion on your desktop. It can be resized and placed anywhere on your desktop. It uses minimal resources and helps give your desktop a dieselpunk make-over.

This VB6 version of the stop watch widget replaces the Xwidget version that is now obsolete.

This widgets UI functionality is complex as I am using my complex template for this widget and widgets yet to come, it allows the user to interact with the graphical elements of the widget. You can switch from a standard clock to a stopwatch and you can change the timezones with the preferences.

It can also be increased in size, opacity/transparency may be set as to the users discretion. The widget can also be made to hide for a pre-determined period.

Right-click on the widget to display the function menu, mouse hover over the widget and press CTRL+mousewheel up/down to resize. It works well on Windows XP to Windows 11 as well as Linux and Mac os x with Wine.

This version was developed on Windows 7 using 32 bit VisualBasic 6 as a FOSS project creating a WoW64 widget for the desktop.

It is open source to allow easy configuration, bug-fixing, enhancement and community contribution towards free-and-useful VB6 utilities that can be created by anyone. The first step was the creation of this template program to form the basis for the conversion of other desktop utilities or 'widgets'. A future step is new VB6 widgets with more functionality and then hopefully, conversion of each to RADBasic/TwinBasic for future-proofing and 64bit-ness.

This utility is one of a set of steampunk and dieselpunk widgets. That you can find here on Deviantart: https://www.deviantart.com/yereverluvinuncleber/gallery

I do hope you enjoy using this utility and others. Your own software enhancements and contributions will be gratefully received if you choose to contribute.

MicroSoft in the 90s - MS built good, lean and useful tools in the late 90s/early 2000s. Thanks MicroSoft for VB6.

Olaf Schmidt    - This tool was built using the RichClient RC6 Cairo wrapper for VB6. Specifically, the components using transparency. Thanks for the massive effort Olaf in creating Cairo counterparts for all VB6 native controls and giving us access to advanced features on controls such as transparency.
