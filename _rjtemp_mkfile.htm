<h1>Steampunk Clock Calendar-VB6</h1>
<p>A FOSS Desktop Utility VB6 WoW64 Widget for Windows XP, ReactOS, Vista, Win7, 8 and 10/11+.</p>
<p>My current VB6/RC6 PSD program being worked upon now, in progress, don't download it yet as it is far from complete. Estimated at 99% graphically complete but only 68% code-ready. This Steampunk Clock Calendar widget will be an attractive steampunk widget for your desktop. It is a deliberately complex clock. Functional and gorgeous at the same time. This VB6 Widget is a moveable widget that you can move anywhere around the
desktop as you require. This is based upon the Yahoo widget of the same design.</p>
<p>If you just want to install, there will be a setup.exe that you download and run. If you want to compile this yourself, clone/download the lot. You will of course, need the VB6 IDE.</p>
<p>Why VB6? Well, with a 64 bit, modern-language improvement upgrade on the way with 100% compatible TwinBasic coupled with support for transparent PNGs via RC/Cairo, VB6 code has an amazing future.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/Panzer-JustClock-VB6/assets/2788342/7986e544-0b94-4a10-90bb-2d9fb60c294a" alt="vb6-logo-200" /></p>
<p>I created this as a development from the original Yahoo widget/ Konfabulator version I had previously created for the steampunk
communities. This widget is an attractive steampunk VB6 widget for your desktop. It is almost all my code with some help from the chaps at VBForums (credits given).</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/Steampunk-clock-calendar-vb6/assets/2788342/c6a5962d-ccc3-43ad-8316-607c122026ee" alt="about-image001" /></p>
<p>This widget can be increased in size, animation speed can be changed,
opacity/transparency may be set as to the users discretion. The widget can
also be made to hide for a pre-determined period.</p>
<p>Right clicking will bring up a menu of options. Double-clicking on the widget will cause a personalised Windows application to
fire up. The first time you run it there will be no assigned function and so it
will state as such and then pop up the preferences so that you can enter the
command of your choice. The widget takes command line-style commands for
windows. Mouse hover over the widget and press CTRL+mousewheel up/down to resize. It works well on Windows Vista
to Windows 11. There will be another version for ReactOS and Windows XP, not yet built, watch this space.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/Steampunk-clock-calendar-version-2.9/assets/2788342/f2dc5337-0c98-418c-9b68-2374ae7c4222" alt="steampunk_clock_calendar_mkii__2_9__rc_by_yereverluvinuncleber-d4l5xny" /></p>
<p>This widget is currently Beta-grade software, under development, not yet
ready to use on a production system - use at your own risk.</p>
<p>This version was developed on Windows 10 64bit using 32 bit VisualBasic 6 as a FOSS
project creating a WoW64 widget for the desktop.</p>
<p>The tool has two modes, Clock mode and Alarm mode. In clock mode the clock ticks, the calendar shows the date.
In alarm mode you can set alarms and when the time has passed the alarm will sound.</p>
<p>Instructions for use:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/Steampunk-clock-calendar-version-2.9/assets/2788342/d8878f9f-a95a-46f0-8fad-d3cf2573aa1a" alt="lookatme" /></p>
<p>It is open source to allow easy configuration, bug-fixing, enhancement and
community contribution towards free-and-useful VB6 utilities that can be created
by anyone. The first step was the creation of a template program to form the
basis for the conversion of other desktop utilities or widgets. A future step
are new VB6 widgets with more functionality and then hopefully, conversion of
each to RADBasic/TwinBasic for future-proofing and 64bit-ness.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/Steampunk-clock-calendar-version-2.9/assets/2788342/00887907-e663-448a-b322-7d6584d95512" alt="wotw-clock-help-image" /></p>
<p>By the left of the calendar are five brass toggles/keys. Pressing on each will have the following effect:</p>
<p>H Key - will show the first help canvas indicated by the brass number 1 on the top left of the wooden
bar. clicking on the brassnumber 1 will select the next drop down help canvas.
Clicking on the ring pull at the bottom will make the current canvas go away.</p>
<p>A Key - will activate the alarm mode and will also show the help canvas the first time
it is pressed. Click on the ring pull at the bottom to make the canvas go away
(f you do this note that it will still be in alarm mode). Clicking on the bell set will also cause
the clock to go into alarm mode.</p>
<p>When you have pressed the A key it will release the slider and you may move it to the right
or left and change time. When you have selected the date/time you want then move the slider
to the central position and click on the bell set. The alarm will set. You can set up to five alarms.</p>
<p>Alarm mode -  Normal operation is this: When the slider is released the further you move the slider from the
centre position the more quickly the date/time will change.</p>
<p>When you are ready to set the alarm, click the bellset, two bells will sound and the alarm is set.</p>
<ul>
<li>Please note that while the timepiece in Alarm Mode all clock functions are switched off *</li>
<li>Alarms will not sound whilst in alarm mode *</li>
</ul>
<p>To cancel an alarm setting or viewing operation just click on the clock face.
To cancel a ringing alarm - just click on the bellset.</p>
<p>Each time you press the alarm bell to set an alarm, a pop-up will display indicating
which alarm you are going to set. Each time you press the A key, it will select the next alarm.
To the right of the clock there are from zero to five alarm toggles depending on how many alarms you
have previously set. f you click on the toggle it will display the date and time set for this alarm.
If you then click on the associated 'cash-register-style' pop-up it will allow you to delete this alarm.</p>
<p>L Key - gently quietens the whole clock: ticking, chimes, alarm sounds all reduced by 21db.</p>
<p>M Key - leaves all other sounds alone but turns off only the chimes. Another click turns the
chimes back on again. You will see the bell clapper move to/from the bell set.</p>
<p>P Key - Turns off the pendulum. Another click turns it on again. Single-click on the pendulum itself
also turns off the pendulum.</p>
<p>Crank - The hand crank is the master volume control. Crank it down to mute all sounds and crank
it up to restore the sound back to the level it was prior to muting.</p>
<p>To the left of the digital clock is another brass toggle:</p>
<p>S Key - Raises the transparent screen logging the various controls you select. Because the screen is
transparent the text may be hard to see when used on a dark desktop background. A new 'B' key
will also appear on the right of the screen frame that allows you to raise/lower the back screen.
This will allow you to read the text.</p>

<p>The screen currently only displays clock/calendar operations but may do more in the future.</p>
<p>At the back-end there are more preferences that may be changed, all are documented by an associated description.</p>
<p>This utility is one of a set of steampunk and dieselpunk widgets. That you can
find here on Deviantart: <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/yereverluvinuncleber/gallery">https://www.deviantart.com/yereverluvinuncleber/gallery</a></p>
<p>I do hope you enjoy using this utility and others. Your own software
enhancements and contributions will be gratefully received if you choose to
contribute.</p>

<p>CREDITS:</p>
<p>I have really tried to maintain the credits as the project has progressed. If I
have made a mistake and left someone out then do forgive me. I will make amends
if anyone points out my mistake in leaving someone out.</p>
<p>MicroSoft in the 90s - MS built good, lean and useful tools in the late 90s and
early 2000s. Thanks for VB6.</p>
<p>Olaf Schmidt - This tool was built using the RichClient RC6 Cairo wrapper for
VB6. Specifically the components using transparency and reading images directly
from PSD. Thanks for the massive effort Olaf in creating Cairo counterparts for
all VB6 native controls and giving us access to advanced features on controls
such as transparency.</p>

<p>Dependencies:</p>
<p>o A windows-alike o/s such as Windows Vista 7-11 or Apple Mac OSX 11.</p>
<p>o Microsoft VB6 IDE installed with its runtime components. The program runs
without any additional Microsoft OCX components, just the basic controls that
ship with VB6.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/Panzer-JustClock-VB6/assets/2788342/861f1ce1-7058-4d09-af94-daab9206ca86" alt="vb6-logo" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Uses the latest version of the RC6 Cairo framework from Olaf Schmidt.</li>
</ul>
<p>During development the RC6 components need to be registered. These scripts are
used to register. Run each by double-clicking on them.</p>
<pre><code>RegisterRC6inPlace.vbs
RegisterRC6WidgetsInPlace.vbs
</code></pre>
<p>During runtime on the users system, the RC6 components are dynamically
referenced using modRC6regfree.bas which is compiled into the binary.</p>
<p>Requires a SteampunkClockCalendar folder in C:\Users&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Roaming\
eg: C:\Users&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Roaming\SteampunkClockCalendar
Requires a settings.ini file to exist in C:\Users&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Roaming\PzJustclock
The above will be created automatically by the compiled program when run for the
first time.</p>
<p>o Krool's replacement for the Microsoft Windows Common Controls found in
mscomctl.ocx (slider) are replicated by the addition of one
dedicated OCX file that are shipped with this package.</p>
<p>During development only, this must be copied to C:\windows\syswow64 and should be registered.</p>
<ul>
<li>CCRSlider.ocx</li>
</ul>
<p>Register this using regsvr32, ie. in a CMD window with administrator privileges.</p>
<pre><code>c:                          ! set device to boot drive with Windows
cd \windows\syswow64s	    ! change default folder to syswow64
regsvr32 CCRSlider.ocx	! register the ocx
</code></pre>
<p>This will allow the custom controls to be accessible to the VB6 IDE
at design time and the sliders will function as intended (if this ocx is
not registered correctly then the relevant controls will be replaced by picture boxes).</p>
<p>The above is only for development, for ordinary users, during runtime there is no
need to do the above. The OCX will reside in the program folder. The program reference
to this OCX is contained within the supplied resource file, saturn.RES. The reference
to this file is already compiled into the binary. As long as the OCX is in the same
folder as the binary the program will run without the need to register the OCX manually.</p>
<ul>
<li>OLEGuids.tlb</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a type library that defines types, object interfaces, and more specific
API definitions needed for COM interop / marshalling. It is only used at design
time (IDE). This is a Krool-modified version of the original .tlb from the
vbaccelerator website. The .tlb is compiled into the executable.
For the compiled .exe this is NOT a dependency, only during design time.</p>
<p>From the command line, copy the tlb to a central location (system32 or wow64
folder) and register it.</p>
<p>COPY OLEGUIDS.TLB %SystemRoot%\System32<br />
REGTLIB %SystemRoot%\System32\OLEGUIDS.TLB</p>
<p>In the VB6 IDE - project - references - browse - select the OLEGuids.tlb</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>SETUP.EXE - The program is currently distributed using setup2go, a very useful
and comprehensive installer program that builds a .exe installer. Youll have to
find a copy of setup2go on the web as it is now abandonware. Contact me
directly for a copy. The file &quot;install PzJustclock 0.1.0.s2g&quot; is the configuration
file for setup2go. When you build it will report any errors in the build.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HELP.CHM - the program documentation is built using the NVU HTML editor and
compiled using the Microsoft supplied CHM builder tools (HTMLHelp Workshop) and
the HTM2CHM tool from Yaroslav Kirillov. Both are abandonware but still do
the job admirably. The HTML files exist alongside the compiled CHM file in the
HELP folder.</p>
