Welcome to the Panzer Stop Watch Widget.</big><br>


<br>


<img style="width: 48px; height: 48px; float: left;" alt="sauron.png" title="sauron.png" src="file:///E:/vb6/Panzer-JustClock-VB6/help/sauron.png">The
Panzer Stop Watch VB6 gauge&nbsp;is a useful utility displaying a
simple stopwatch
in a dieselpunk fashion on your desktop. It can be resized and placed
anywhere on your desktop. It uses minimal resources and helps give your
desktop a dieselpunk make-over. This help file describes just the
stopwatch widget and not the other widgets shown above. The others
are javascript desktop widgets that will be converted to VB6 'widgets'
one at a time as time allows.<br>


<br>


Right-click on the widget to display the function menu, mouse hover
over the widget and press CTRL+mousewheel up/down to resize. It works
well on Windows XP to Windows 11.<br>


<br>


This version was developed on Windows 7/10 using 32 bit VisualBasic 6
as a
FOSS project, creating a WoW64 widget for the desktop. <br>


<br>


It is open source to allow easy configuration, bug-fixing, enhancement
and community contribution towards a set of free-and-useful VB6
utilities that can be created by anyone. The first step was the
creation of this template program to form the basis for the conversion
of other desktop utilities or 'widgets' from other engines as shown
above. A future step is new VB6 widgets with more functionality and
then hopefully, conversion of each to RADBasic/TwinBasic for
future-proofing and 64bit-ness. <br>


<br>


This utility is one of a set of steampunk and dieselpunk widgets. That
you can find them all here on Deviantart:
<a href="https://www.deviantart.com/yereverluvinuncleber/gallery">https://www.deviantart.com/yereverluvinuncleber/gallery</a><br>


<br>


I do hope you enjoy using this utility and others. Your own software
enhancements and contributions will be gratefully received if you ever
choose to contribute.<br>


<br>


Please note that some of the images below refer to identical widgets
with a different name. The functionality will be the same.<br>


<div class="indent">
<h3>Installation</h3>


<img style="width: 48px; height: 48px; float: left;" alt="sauron.png" title="sauron.png" src="file:///E:/vb6/Panzer-JustClock-VB6/help/sauron.png">When
you run the&nbsp;SETUP.EXE a splash screen will appear for 1 brief
second,
then it will suggest default locations where you can install this
utility. When the installation is complete it will run the program.
That is it.<br>


<br>


To uninstall the program, there is an uninstall.exe that will
remove the application for you in the program folder. If you ever want
to to reinstall a new version of the program, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">always uninstall the old
version beforehand</span>.<br>


<br>


<h3>Anti Virus Tools</h3>


<img style="width: 48px; height: 48px; float: left;" alt="sauron.png" title="sauron.png" src="file:///E:/vb6/Panzer-JustClock-VB6/help/sauron.png">&nbsp;When you install the Panzer Stop Watch Widget for the first time you
will
need to accept that your anti-virus tool will pause the installation to
test the installation program for malware. Due to this program being
written in VB6 and being a new program your a/v tool has not
encountered, it WILL flag it as being potentially malware. This is a
FALSE POSITIVE. This only occurs with such tools as Avast or similar,
see below.<br>


<br>


If you do not feel at ease with running this tool with an exception for
malware scans, then I suggest <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you uninstall it and
instead only run
software you trust</span>. To help you gain that trust, the
source code for
this utility is on github. You can view and edit that code at your
leisure and you can even compile the code for yourself. This should
give you the confidence that you need. There is a link on the tool's
right click menu that will take you straight through to the github page
here: <a href="https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/Panzer-StopWatch-Clock-VB6">https://github.com/yereverluvinunclebert/Panzer-StopWatch-Clock-VB6</a><br>


<br>


The
a/v tool I have
installed on my PC is Avast - the following&nbsp;is what occurs on
installation on my system: When Avast first encounters the SETUP.EXE
file
it will test this for malware, it takes approx. 20-30 seconds to
complete a scan. Let it finish. Once done, the setup will then run the
installation and finally it will run Panzer Stop Watch
Cairo Widget itself. At this point Avast will do another scan to test
the Panzer Stop Watch Widget program binary (the .exe file) which will
take
another 30 seconds or so. When that second scan is complete you will
find the Panzer Stopwatch on your desktop running nomally.<br>


<br>


Until
the Avast databases are updated and it fully trusts the program, Avast
may try to scan it every time it is run. This is a pain but it will
eventually go away. In the meantime, if you want to prevent
your a/v tool from scanning (and being continually intrusive on a
trusted program
such as this) then you will need to set an exception or an exclusion
within
Avast (or whichever anti-virus tool you use). &nbsp;Eventually, the
creators of the various a/v tools will become familiar with this
particular utility and the binary will no longer raise any false
positives
nor alarms. <br>


<br>


This is a new VB6 utility so it is an inevitable occurrence -
being a new and unknown binary, it is of course&nbsp;frustrating
but it
will eventually go away.&nbsp;<br>


<br>


<h3>Basic Functionality</h3>


<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><img style="width: 48px; height: 48px; float: left;" alt="sauron.png" title="sauron.png" src="file:///E:/vb6/Panzer-JustClock-VB6/help/sauron.png">When
you
install and run the
widget for the first time it will present you with the licence screen
and launch the prefs. You must accept the licence terms to proceed
further. The Preference screen allows you to configure the
functionality of &nbsp;the clock component of the Panzer Stop Watch
'widget'. The clock will also appear on your main monitor,
animating slowly using minimal resources. This widget's functionality
is limited as it is just a template for widgets yet to come, however,
it can be increased in size, animation speed can be changed,
opacity/transparency may be set as to the user's discretion. The widget
can also be made to hide for a pre-determined period. If the
application is already running then you can double-click to run a new
instance of the binary and you will have two or more clocks running on
the desktop. As each Panzer Stop Watch running program is a mere
desktop 'Widget',
each
instance will not appear on the taskbar unless you configure it to do
so. Widgets tend to operate underneath all
your other programs and sit quietly on the desktop doing their thing.<br>

When you select this option the brief&nbsp;one-screen help pop-up
will appear.as above.<br>


<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>


</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Locking Pin</span><br>


<br>


The widget can be made to lock into place so that it cannot be moved.
This will also store the widget's current X,Y location on the screen,
storing these values in the preferences under the Position Tab.
If the widget is restarted it will relocate to this position
automatically. <br>


<br>


<span style="font-weight: bold;">Preferences&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Button</span><br>

The Widget Preferences screen will be described in more detail in the
Preferences section of this help document. See below.<br>


<br>


<span style="font-weight: bold;">Stop </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Button</span><br>


<br>


When in stopwatch mode the stop button ends the
stopwatch function. When pressed, the hand will
rotate forward to the zero position.<br>


<br>


In clock mode this button stops the clock hands from rotating.<br>


<br>


<span style="font-weight: bold;">Start </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Button - Clock Mode<br>

<br>


<span style="font-weight: bold;">Start </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Button - Stopwatch Mode<br>


<br>


</span>
When in stopwatch mode the start button&nbsp;starts/pauses and
restarts
the stopwatch function. When you first press the button the main clock
hands will rotate away and park themselves to a location on the clock
face where they will not obscure any stopwatch functions. <br>


<br>


In stopwatch mode, a second press of the button and the stopwatch hands
will pause but the stopwatch will keep running in the background.<br>


<br>


In stopwatch mode, when the hands are paused the digital second display
will keep running and displaying the current seconds. <br>


<br>


In stopwatch mode, when you press the button again to restart, the hand
will rotate forward to the current actual position and the timing run
will continue.<br>


<br>


<br>


<br>


<span style="font-weight: bold;">Tick Control Button<br>


</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<br>


The tick control button toggles the second hand movement from a one
second tick to a more smooth flow.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>


<br>


</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Reveal Widget in Windows
Explorer.</span><br>


<br>


When you select this option, a file explorer window will open using the
folder location where your application is situated. A most useful
function
to find the application quickly.<br>


<br>


<span style="font-weight: bold;">Reload Widget (F5).</span><br>


<br>


This option quietly stops and restarts the Panzer Stop Watch Widget. On
the rare
occasion
that the Panzer Stop Watch Widget&nbsp;has a tiny problem, possibly
due to an
unforeseen bug - in that case&nbsp;you can simply reset
it by
reloading the widget. In addition, if the widget has focus then a
key-press on the F5 key
will also
restart the widget. Be aware this is a soft-reload, just initialising
and re-running the main software components. <br>


<br>


If you want to perform a hard restart, ie. program closing and
restarting then you can press SHIFT+R. The program will shutdown and
use the restart binary to restart itself.<br>


<br>


<span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit Widget</span><br>


<br>


This menu option only appears if the DEBUG selection option is ON in
the Development Preferences. In the prefs, enter the path here to Stop
Watch widget's
.vbp file (a VB6 project file). If the widget's source code has been
downloaded from github, unpacked and placed somewhere
locally - in addition, if you have installed the VB6 IDE, this menu
option will add an option to conveniently launch the VB6 IDE, opening
up the project, so you can edit the program, re-code and compile
dynamically.
&nbsp;A
link to the current github location will be found on the update button
on the
about page of the preferences.<br>


<br>


<span style="font-weight: bold;">Switch off my functions
&amp; Turn all my functions ON</span><br>


<br>


These options are a toggle to stop and start the rotation of the hour,
minute, second hands and date functions.<br>


<br>


<span style="font-weight: bold;">Lock Widget</span><br>


<br>


The widget can be made to lock into place so that it cannot be moved.
This will also store the widget's current X,Y location on the screen,
storing these values in the preferences under the Position Tab.
If the widget is restarted it will relocate to this position
automatically.&nbsp;<br>


<br>


<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></div>


<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hide Widget for 'n'
Minutes</span><br>


<br>


The&nbsp;widget can be made to&nbsp;hide temporarily so that it
does not interfere
with
the running of other programs that&nbsp;require all of your screen
space. It will re-appear automatically in a pre-determined time. The
default time to hide can be modified in the
settings/preferences, by default it is 1 minute.<br>


<br>


<br>


<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>

General Panel contains the most important user-configurable items
required for the program to operate correctly. <br>


You can enable or disable the ticking hands functionality.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline ! important; float: none;">The
hands can also be modified to run in a smoother fashion, this will
slightly increase CPU usage as it forces the widget to use a more
frequent timer that works on a 200ms access time, when placing the hands</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline ! important; float: none;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline ! important; float: none;"></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline ! important; float: none;">On
modern systems the CPU usage of this widget is negligible less being
than 0.1%. As a result&nbsp;the
overhead can be safely ignored. The function to disable the widget is
merely here to replicate the functionality of the Yahoo and Xwidget
versions of this widget. <br>


<br>


You can select the timezone for this clock as
well as enabling or disabling daylight savings time. By default it will
use the system time. Any changes to these two options will modify the
clock immediately. The bias field is a read-only field that displays
the current bias in minutes taking into account the timezone and the
Daylight Savings options.&nbsp;<br>


<br>


The auto start option allows the widget to automatically run on system
restart. The program is very slimline and will have little or no impact
on system startup times.<br>

The
option
to show the widget in the taskbar is useful as it allows you to hide
the taskbar entry for this widget so the
taskbar remains uncluttered. Typically widgets sit beneath the user's
programs populating the "underside of the desktop", as it were. You may
have 40-50 </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline ! important; float: none;">useful

running in the background and these operate without polluting the user
experience, each
being slimline in operation. Therefore, it makes no sense to have the
taskbar cluttered by multiple widgets. This option is here just for
those that might run one or two such programs and desire to have their
widget appearing in the taskbar and acting more as an ordinary Windows
program (which it really is).<br>


<br>


The DPI awareness toggle requires the widget to be 'hard' started in
order to take effect, ie. a&nbsp;program close and re-open. As well
as
the main program binary there is also a&nbsp;
restart.exe in the app folder that is called by this option, this
small&nbsp;program simply restarts the widget itself and no more.<br>


<br>


DPI awareness allows the program to respond to the o/s scaling of the
desktop, including handling the scaleable fonts so that they remain
crisp and clear. Some prefer the old school look of non-DPI aware apps.
That option is for you. If you have a smaller screen this option will
be best switched off.<br>

<br>


<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>


Aspect Ratio Hidden
Mode:&nbsp; </span>We
suggest that you don't fiddle with this unless you really know what you
are doing,&nbsp;unintended side effects might surprise you! This
option
was originally created for Windows on tablet devices and so it is not
much use on standard Windows on a typical desktop system where the
screen orientation rarely changes. Here you can choose whether the Pz
Earth widget is hidden by
default, in either landscape or portrait mode - or not at all. This
option
allows you to ensure this widget does not obscure the screen in one or
the other screen modes, landscape or portrait. If you accidentally
enable it so you can't
find your widget on screen at all then change the setting here to NONE.
If the widget is accidentally hidden then it will reappear after a set
interval has elapsed.<br>


<br>

Percent: </span>The widget can be positioned proportionally when
switching between portrait/landscape.&nbsp; <br>

The widget can be locked into a certain position in either

prefs panel itself remembers its own position. When you locate the
prefs pane elsewhere on the desktop and click the close button, it will
save the current position and locate the pane in that location next
time the prefs are opened. Be aware that the prefs pane has a position
stored for both high and low DPI settings, each is stored separately.
Whenever you move the prefs pane then a timer stores the current
position every five seconds meaning that if you kill it using the 'X'
button top right, the position might not yet be saved. Wait a second or
two after relocating the prefs pane.<br>

<h3>Technology:&nbsp;<br>


</h3>


<img style="width: 48px; height: 48px; float: left;" alt="sauron.png" title="sauron.png" src="file:///E:/vb6/Panzer-JustClock-VB6/help/sauron.png">The
utility was created using VB6 and the RC6/Cairo graphic wrapper from
Olaf Schmidt. Some brief history: VB6 was once Microsoft's vaunted
flagship
language but they abandoned it. I used VB6 to a) prove it can be done
and b) to reacquaint
myself
with the technology further. Olaf's RC6 upgrades VB6 to use a
multi-platform modern graphics engine not dependent of VB6 native
forms. In addition a chap called Wayne Phillips has come up with a VB6
alternative that is 100% VB6 language compatible&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">and is also 64bit</span>.
The utility will be migrated to TwinBasic
next so there WILL be a version that is future-proof<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>.
<br>


<br>


When the 64bit version exists, this help
file
will apply to either version as they will be
functionally identical. This program was built upon Windows 7, in my
opinion
Microsoft's last good desktop
operating system with a decent GUI - with no nags, no tiles nor
advertising. However, it can also be developed on Win10/11+ and above,
just
as well. It also runs and operates with no issues at all on all later
versions of this operating system. It has also been tested on Linux and
Mac OSX, both running Wine.

to
using VB6, I also used&nbsp;MZ-TOOLS 3.0 &amp; ver 8.0,
CodeHelp Core
IDE Extender
Framework
2.2, vbAdvance, some of Shaggrat's IDE addins (map &amp; code
folder) and Rubberduck. <br>


<br>


This
program was built with the assistance of various snippets or chunks of
FOSS code. VB6 has been around for so long that&nbsp;the codebase
is
immense. You can find snippets to do this or that and I have utilised a
few bits of code for this dock which has sped the development
process <span style="text-decoration: underline;">immeasurably</span>.<br>


<br>


Olaf Schmidt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - This tool was
built using the
RichClient RC6 Cairo wrapper for VB6. Specifically the components using
transparency. &nbsp;Olaf made changes to his libraries specifically
for my needs - impressive. Thanks
for the massive effort
Olaf in creating Cairo counterparts for all the native VB6 controls and
giving us access to advanced features&nbsp;such as image and
control transparency.&nbsp;In addition, this
program makes use of Olaf's PSD parser. His code allows the
program to make use of a Photoshop PSD file that contains its
transparent graphics in layered form.

like me create these tools and we do it for&nbsp;nothing,
for
free, gratis. However, it makes my day when someone sends a gift, a
treat or a present and it inspires me to do more. In all the time that
I have created all these tools (thirty or more tools) I have received
no more than a dozen or so
gifts but when someone has done so I feel like I have just
inherited&nbsp;a new friend. All I ask is that if you use this tool
and
continue to do so, consider sending me something small once every few
years. I have a penchant for liquorice and cheap SSDs, the former is
cheap and brings a smile to my face, the latter has me running round
the room in circles. There is a link to Kofi on the right click menu.<br>
